# NumpadIPA
> **numpadipa** /ˌnʊm.pəˈdaɪ.pə/ *n.* - a keyboard layout that uses the numpad keys, allowing the user to type the "entire" International Phonetic Alphabet.

## Introduction
As an aspiring linguist and [conlanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language), I need to write [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA) symbols quite often, when describing a language's phonology, or sound system. For a long time, I simply copy-pasted the symbols from the  Wikipedia page, but this quickly became too cumbersome. Thus, my search for keyboard layouts began.

### Alternatives
First, I stumbled across the TypeIt keyboard, which is a website that has point-and-click support for many different languages, including a large portion of the IPA. It has some shortcuts as well, to allow for easier typing. Still, though, you have to type in the website's box instead of the program you want to actually have the text in.

Another keyboard, recommended and used by many, is the series of SIL keyboard layouts. These are real, installable keyboard layouts that make use of key sequences to produce many IPA characters. For example (depending on which keyboard you choose), <kbd>t</kbd><kbd>=</kbd> produces <kbd>θ</kbd>. However, it overrides keys I want to be able to use normally as well, like <kbd>:</kbd> and <kbd>$</kbd>. This means I constantly had to switch keyboard layouts while using this.

### Concept
Both these keyboards are good, but I felt I needed something better. Something that I could use to type in every program, but did not compromise on existing keys. This inspired me to create my own keyboard layout, and I quickly realized my keyboard had an entire sixteen-key section that I had never used before: the *numpad*.
