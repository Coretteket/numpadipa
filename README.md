# NumpadIPA
> **numpadipa** /ˌnʊm.pəˈdaɪ.pə/ *n.* - a keyboard layout that uses the numpad keys, allowing the user to type the "entire" International Phonetic Alphabet.

## Introduction
As an aspiring linguist and [conlanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language), I need to write [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA) symbols quite often, when describing a language's phonology, or sound system. For a long time, I simply copy-pasted the symbols from the  Wikipedia page, but this quickly became too cumbersome.

### Alternatives
First, I stumbled across the TypeIt keyboard, which is a website that has point-and-click support for many different languages, including a large portion of the IPA. It has some shortcuts as well, to allow for easier typing. Still, though, you had to type in the website's box instead of the program you want to actually have the text in.
